# hdt-wasm


## Status
The project is nowhere close to a production-ready build with a stable api.
Yet, it is already able to compile with no major issue and run a dummy "helloworld" example.


## Getting started

Be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) on your system (test with `em++ --version`). Do not use the ones from Ubuntu repos, they are outdated.

The dependencies below are required too:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool pkg-config
```

Build with:
```bash



```
